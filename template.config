#  Gereric selection: http://www.ospo.noaa.gov/Products/imagery/index.html
#  GOES East/GOES West - Land sectors: http://www.ospo.noaa.gov/Products/imagery/land.html
#  TIFF files (not recommented):
#    ftp://satepsanone.nesdis.noaa.gov/GIS/GOESeast/
#    ftp://satepsanone.nesdis.noaa.gov/GIS/GOESwest/
# Paste the selected links in the corresponding GETIMAGE variables.
#
# ######## SETTING POSITIONS ########
# Set image position distance with regard to DIMENSIONS setting, from topleft.
# The format is SignNumberSignNumber where Sign is "+" or "-" and Number is an integer in pixels. 
# Hint 1:
#  You can use GIMP to find a nice looking arrangement.
#  First create an empty image file with dimensions as shown in the variable DIMENSIONS.
#  Then paste as layers the three images you have selected.
#  Move the images as you like and when you finilize their positions 
#  view their pixel properties and do some simple math.
# Hint 2: 
#  Default overlay order (floor to ceiling) is img1, img2, img3, legend, info.
#  Keep in mind that for EUMETSAT:
# "Channels" images (IR, VIS, WV) update every 1h
# "RGB Composites" images update every 1h
# "Visualised Products" (AMV) updates every 1h
# "Visualised Products" (MPE, FIR, CLM, CTH) update every 15min
# "Visualised Products" (CLA, CLAI) update every 3h
# For NOAA (US): images used on LiveWB are updated every 30 minutes
# Label 		Abbreviation 	Enhancement Descriptions:
# Visible 		VIS 		Unenhanced Visible imagery that transitions to IR2 overnight
# Shortwave (IR2) 	IR2 		Channel 2 Shortwave Infrared imagery - Shortwave, sometimes considered "night visible"
# Fire (IR2) 		IR2F 		IR Channel 2 with the standard fire enhancement
# Fire Hot
			IR2H 		IR Channel 2 with enhancemnet for the hot summer season
# Fire Winter
			IR2W 		IR Channel 2 with enhancement for the cool winter season
# Water Vapor 		WV 		IR Channel 3
# RGB 			RGB 		Combination of Visible and IR using a three channel technique to form a Red/Green/Blue false color image.
# None 			IR4 		Unenhanced Channel 4 Infrared Imagery
# AVN 			AVN 		Aviation color enhancement
# Dvorak 		BD 		Dvorak enhancement - used for Tropical Classifications with the Dvorak Technique
# Funktop 		FT 		Funktop enhancement - developed by Ted Funk. Highlights intense areas of precipitation
# JSL 			JSL 		JSL2 enhancement - developed by Jim Lynch. Used to bring out low level and hight level clouds in tropical cyclones
# Rainbow 		RB 		Rainbow enhancement curve - Colorful enhancement
