#
# ######## SETTING POSITIONS ########
# Set image position distance with regard to DIMENSIONS setting, from topleft.
# The format is SignNumberSignNumber where Sign is "+" or "-" and Number is an integer in pixels. 
# Hint 1:
#  You can use GIMP to find a nice looking arrangement.
#  First create an empty image file with dimensions as shown in the variable DIMENSIONS.
#  Then paste as layers the three images you have selected.
#  Move the images as you like and when you finilize their positions 
#  view their pixel properties and do some simple math.
# Hint 2: 
#  Default overlay order (floor to ceiling) is img1, img2, img3, legend, info.
#  Keep in mind that:
# "Channels" images (IR, VIS, WV) update every 1h
# "RGB Composites" images update every 1h
# "Visualised Products" (AMV) updates every 1h
# "Visualised Products" (MPE, FIR, CLM, CTH) update every 15min
# "Visualised Products" (CLA, CLAI) update every 3h
